# Grow with Google Project 1 Portfolio

This is my iteration of the project 1 where we were requested to create a portfolio based off of a mock up we were given. We were allowed to make style changes and image changes based on what we wanted the site to look like for ourselves.

## Getting Started

Simply download my `index.html` file and linked style sheets with images and you are good to go!
